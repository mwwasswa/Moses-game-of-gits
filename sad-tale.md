House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Slight revision to the story, Ned's adpoted son actually got sent to a far away land where he would serve as a watchman forever

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Unsure of the actual GoT story, but all I know is this one awesome woman became bruptly crazy and destroyed an entire city before being killed herself by the Jon guy.

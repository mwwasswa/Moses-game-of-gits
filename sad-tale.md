House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.


Ned became the King's right hand man, which ultimately led to his death because, of course its how it always goes when you are in the service of royality. His son sought revenge for his father's death and ended up the king in the end.
